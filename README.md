# Predict_Calories-Model
Made by Brighton Chan and Lincoln Ma


## Problem Identification
When we were given a random meal,we do not know how much calories that we were
comsuming. In our data frame, we were given (cols) which can used to predict
the calories for receipes in our data set so we can tell how much calories are
we comsuming if the food item dont have the calories label.

It could be useful for the majority of the people who cares about health since
food items in resteraunts were not forced to include a calories messurement and 
people may consuming too much calories so that it may lead to some health 
issues like diabetes. Some medical company could use this data to create a 
calories checking app so it can reduce unintention calories comsumption.
