# Research on Food Recipes and Ratings
Made by Brighton Chan and Lincoln Ma


## Introduction
We consume food not only because they give us energy, we also eat food because they taste good. Therefore, restaurants needs reviews and ratings from their consumers so that they know how to improve their recipes. In this project, we hope to see whether the number of ingredients used in the recipe tend to receieve a higher average rating.
